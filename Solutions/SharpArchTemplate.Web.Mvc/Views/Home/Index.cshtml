        are to:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Create your database and set the connection string
                within SharpArchTemplate.Web.Mvc/NHibernate.config</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                Optionally, modify the Fluent NHibernate preferences within SharpArchTemplate.Data.NHibernateMaps.GetConventions()
                if you don't like the default settings.  There's lots of terrific info about Fluent NHibernate
                at <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/HomePage">http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/HomePage</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open SharpArchTemplate.Tests.dll via NUnit and make sure all the tests are turning green.
            </li>
        </ol>
